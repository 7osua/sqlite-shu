# SQLite-Shu

SQLite is an open-source, zero-configuration, self-contained, stand-alone,
transaction relational database engine designed to be embedded into an
application.

SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management
system. The lite in SQLite means lightweight in terms of setup, database
administration, and required resources.

In this repo I will learn :

- Learn SQLite step by step through extensive hands-on practice.
- Develop backend database by using SQLite.
- Practice to manage structured data in applications, including web apps and
  mobile apps.
